# Organizing Events - Sinatra Ruby + React Web Application
This is a web application built using the Sinatra Ruby framework for the backend and React for the frontend. The application allows users to organize and manage events, including creating events, RSVPing, and viewing event details.

# Features
User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out.
Event Creation: Users can create new events by providing event details such as title, description, date, and location.
Event RSVP: Users can RSVP to events and indicate their attendance status.
Event Listing: Users can view a list of all events, including details such as the event title, date, and location.
Event Details: Users can view detailed information about a specific event, including the event description and RSVP status.
User Profile: Users have a profile page where they can view their created events and events they have RSVPed to.
# Technologies Used
Backend: Sinatra Ruby framework for handling HTTP requests and managing data storage.
Frontend: React JavaScript library for building user interfaces and providing an interactive user experience.
Database: PostgreSQL for storing user information, event details, and RSVP status.
CSS Framework: Use your preferred CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Bulma) for styling the application.
API Integration: Integrate with external APIs (e.g., Google Maps API) for displaying event locations and other relevant information.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku) to make it accessible online.
